# RUB-Login
A simple Ruby script to login to the university network used in Akafö accomodation of Ruhr-Universität Bochum. 

# Usage
The easiest way to use it is just to replace the username and password fields in the settings hash to your loginid of the network.
After that just running the script will do the login.

The script can also be used together with NetworkManager, to login automatically when the computer is connected to the network.
To do that just copy the script to /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ and make root user to be its owner. When a network
interface has gone up, the script will check whether we are in the correct network (by pinging the gateway ip), and will then
try to do the login.

# Requirements
- Mechanize
- net/ping (optional)
